I have decided to do a simple calculator for this project and submit it with a documentation file
	going line by line with what is going on in the program in hopes of learning the Elixir better and
	ensuring I have a proper understanding of the language.
	
Line 1: This line is simply the named function line similar to C++ with int main(), but instead of ending 
	with a parenthesis it end with do.

Line 2: Within the named function of line one exist another function on line two in this case called sum.
	The purpose of sum in this case is to except a list of integers and to allocate space for a variable 
	named total for later use.

Line 3: This line tells the computer what to do with the input from line two and then displays the results.

Line 4: This line is currently commented out but its purpose was meant to throw up an exception handler in
	case the user attempted to insert anything other than an integer. I will still be needing to practice
	how to use exceptions in this language as (having demonstrated here) I have not quite understood how to
	properly implement them.
	
Line 5: left blank for readability purposes.

Line 6 through Line 17 : These lines are essentially the the same as lines two and three just replaced with 
	subtraction, multiplication, and division. The only difference would be lines nine and ten as well as 
	lines fourteen and fifteen. I attempted to do the multiplication in the same manor as the addition, but
	kept getting 0 as the product. So I proceeded to dig around on the internet a little and found a publication
	on Elixir that wrote as I show here, but I can't help but think there should be a simpler way of writing
	this than as I have done.
	
Line 19: marks the end of the named function and I would assume works the same as the ending bracket in
	other languages.
